# Simulation and Analysis of Supply Chain Contracts in the FMCG Sector (Dairy)

## 📌 Objective
To simulate and evaluate the effectiveness of different supply chain contracts—such as **Buyback**, **Revenue-Sharing**, and **Cost-Sharing**—in an FMCG context, using milk as a case product. The goal is to understand how contract design impacts costs, risks, margins, and coordination between suppliers and retailers.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Supply chains in the FMCG sector are prone to inefficiencies, especially due to high demand variability and perishability. Poor contract design can lead to:
- Misaligned incentives
- Overstock or understock issues
- Reduced profitability
- Coordination failures between supply chain partners

---

## 🔧 Tools Used
- **Google Sheets / Excel** – Data modeling, contract simulations, margin & cost calculations
- **PowerPoint (PDF)** – Final report and executive summary

## 🔁 Project Workflow

1. **End-to-End SCM Context Setup**  
   - Demand Planning  
   - Inventory Management  
   - Procurement & Sourcing  
   - Logistics Strategy  
   - Risk & Resilience Planning  
   - KPI Monitoring  

2. **Contract Design Simulation**  
   - Implemented 3 contract types:
     - Buyback
     - Revenue Sharing
     - Cost Sharing
   - Compared margins, costs, and risk levels under each

3. **Sensitivity Analysis**  
   - Evaluated how lead time and demand variability affect performance under each contract

4. **Insights & Recommendations**  
   - Identified optimal contract for stable and variable markets  
   - Suggested risk-sharing structures that balance both profit and resilience

## 📈 Key Features of the Project
- Realistic dataset modeled on milk distribution in FMCG supply chains  
- Fully automated sheet to calculate:
  - Retailer & supplier profits
  - Net margin across contracts
  - Risk vs reward ratios  
- Visual dashboards (in Excel) to compare performance
- Strategic insights for improving SCM through better contracts

## 💡 Key Takeaways

> "FMCG companies can leverage well-designed supply chain contracts to enhance coordination, minimize risks, and maximize overall profitability."

- Align incentives → fewer disputes  
- Share risk → more resilience  
- Improve forecasting → reduce bullwhip effect  
- Faster replenishment cycles through better contract terms
